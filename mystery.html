            Walking through the doors, a constant bombardment of pain and shock rang throughout my body. Shells dropping everywhere. I was stuck in a dark and musky tunnel with no light in sight. I felt my way around the walls, only feeling the shocks flow through the ground even more violent. I had no where to go. No where to run. I desperatley ran as fast as I could, feeling each step strike the floor, I sucked up all the energy in my body just to go the slightest bit faster. I felt my legs give out. My breathing halted, as I fell towards the ground. Suddenly, a bright light shined above me. I reached out, and grabbed it. But, the light immedietly disappeared and shattered into a million pieces right into my hand. I look at myself from that bridge that connected me from myself. I looked over the horizon over the bridge. A crack formed. Then, more cracks formed. and suddenly, the panks of the bridge started to spring everywhere, slowly coming to end at me. Then, for no reason at all, the bridge stopped collapsing from both sides. I put my hands on the remaining part of the rope of the bridge, gripping it tightly. He started out into the wilderness with fear and darkness in his eyes. Blank and lost. Then, he looked towards the bright colors, moving and chaotic. He reached out. Jumping from the bridge towards the colors. Words and letters and numbers and formulas flashing in my head, overwhelming and chaotic. His thoughts ran wild so much that he froze and I thought of running. Then, he woke up. Sweaty and shocked from his mind. He stared towards the paper and pen, shook his head, and began writing. As he wrote, he looked around the room for something to remember, but it was all a blur. he got out of his chair, and then I lsitened carefully. I heard music coming from outside the door. Cluelessly, I walked towards the door and tried to open it. It was locked from the outside and inside. I tried desperatley clawig my way out. The door. The window. The walls. The vents. No space left to get out, except that screen and keyboard. Giving up, I sat on the chair, and logged into the screen. It showed me a prompt. "Begin?" At first I had no idea waht this mean, but relunctantly typed yes. When I typed yes, flashed of words and ideas flashed my mind. I grabbed one, snatching it and keeping it safe. I started to type, letting my mind and fingers run wherever they please. Eventually, I look back at what I wrote. Suprised that I wrote about how he feels. About how he feels about me. He would want me to be the greatest version of me. I would want for me to be happy. I want to be at peace with myself. I know I can be better. I listen to other people yell and shout. But, I don't let that bother me. I want to let bad words towards me fly by and pass me. But they strike me each time. I want to be at peace with others. I will commit everyday to finding out something I love about myself. I want to not be afriad of talking. I am so afraid whenever I open my mouth. I fear that someone will judge me and think of of me as a mockery. But I am more than that. I am more than a figment of someone else. I am me.</p>

            I woke up from my night's sleep, hearing the birds chirp and my bed rustle as I struggled to get out. I imagined all the things that might happen today. Is my love confessing her feelings to me? Am I failing my test? I failed at everything. All at once. Negative emotions flooded me. Overshadowing all sense of hope I had for myself. He stood there for almost 20 minutes, contemplating who he was. He went to the bathroom and looked into the mirror, but saw no one. He saw a blur. A blur that moved with no sense of direction or thought. A blue that drifted and followed the current. He looked toward another blur. He remembered it. He couldn't remember where it was from but he remembered it. He looked toward the blur, getting closer and closer. Eventually, it was right in his face, but it disappeared instantly. He knew what it was, but needed help to track where it would be or came from. He thought back to a time. A time when it was simple. A time when he was given just one task: don't lose your love. He was tasked with the most simple task, and he failed. He lost it, and without it, he wandered the lands of his life with no purpose and regret. He knew he would need it later, and he was tormented at the thought of not having love. Love would be the thing that would skyrocket him to success, but it wasn't there anymore. No longer there to help him save him or carry him. He was lost. Desperately, he checked everywhere. The floors. The ground. The concrete. The rooms. The different pockets of the backpack. He looked and searched everywhere, but it was no use. Shame. Shame washed over him, each and every time he looked into that blur of love. He wanted it so bad, but it was no use to try and find love in this wretched place that he lived in. No amount of work or effort could ever lead to success. It was no use. It was his fault. It's his fault he felt this way. It's his fault he lost everything. His fault he couldn't remember. He looked at himself in the mirror. His flaws highlighted themselves. Only he could see the flaws and not the upsides. Though he could help anyone and everyone, he was the only one who could help himself, and he couldn’t. It was no use to do anything. He wasn’t in control. It felt like ants controlled him, forcing him to do random things and think stuff for him. He spent the rest of the day, going to math class, going to Spanish class, playing sports, and thinking about his lost love. Eventually, the day passed and it had reached the end of the school day. Slouching in his chair, he leaned back, imagining the love, in the grasp of his hand. But it would be a short-lived imagination, seeing that he had more problems to solve within him. Suddenly, he was back on the bridge, looking out towards the open waters. He stood there, and for a moment, was at peace with himself. He thought of only the now. Not the past nor the future. The now was so much more peaceful. And there, he waited and waited.
